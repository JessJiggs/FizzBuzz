# FizzBuzz
2023-05-21; Trialling fizzbuzz problem/solution and relevant tests. 


Hello. 

My name is Jess and I'm a jnr Ruby developer (so far). 
I recently completed a bootcamp (Le Wagon Fullstack web-dev) and since bought a book (The Self Taught Programmer by Cory Althoff). 

Project goals: 
- Practice TDD (RSpec). Thanks Rory. Thanks The Odin Project.
- Kickoff a routine of frequently building small projects to keep up my programming skills.
  > practice, practice, practice.
  > git/github
  > TDD
  > clean, efficient code
  > discovering new tech/languages

TIL: 
- the difference between merge and rebase (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

Give me a shout if you have any questions, comments, suggestions or funny jokes. 

Thanks for all the fish!
